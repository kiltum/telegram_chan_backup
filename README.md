# Telegram channel backup

Here is very simple program to backup any telegram channel. 

Grab only name and text from channel. Nothing more, but code is simple - you can modify as much as you want

You need only api_id and api_hash from https://my.telegram.org

TODO: I am too lazy to wait for end of chat, so I make infinite loop. 
So if nothing new appears for a long time - backup is done :)
